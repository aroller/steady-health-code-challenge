# Steady Health Code Challenge

This is the code challenge for Steady Health and the objective is to build a wiki web app.

The requirements of the app are the following:

* A page is accessed through the URL pattern /(page_title) and should render the page title and text content.
* Each word in the text content should be linked to a page, if it matches the title of an existing page.
* The home page should list and link all existing pages.

## Example

Given the pages Hypertext, Cunningham and Wiki (see /pages folder), the page for /Wiki should be rendered as:

A <a href="/Wiki">Wiki</a> is a website on which users collaboratively modify <a href="/Hypertext">Hypertext</a>
and structure it directly from the web browser.

Ward <a href="/Cunningham">Cunningham</a>, the developer of the first wiki software,
originally described it as "the simplest online database that could possibly work".

## Additional Hints

* Editing or creating pages is not expected for this challenge.
* Using the flat files in pages as the data source is recommended.
* Page titles can be restricted to CamelCase (no spaces and special characters).
* Case sensitive matching for titles is acceptable, but they should still be linked if followed by punctuation characters. (i.e. "Hypertext, hyperlink" links to /Hypertext, but not to /Hypertext.)

The focus should be on clean, maintainable and secure code.
The choice of programming language, frameworks, tools and libraries is up to you.

Once youâ€™re satisfied with your solution, please push your code to a GitHub repo and let us know.
We'll then continue with a 30 minute call to walkthrough your solution.

If you have any questions, please reach out to jake@steady.health.

We hope you enjoy this challenge and value the time you put into this.

Thank you!

The Steady Team.
