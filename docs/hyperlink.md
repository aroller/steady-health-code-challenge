In computing, a [Hyperlink](hyperlink.md), or simply a link, is a reference to data that the
reader can directly follow either by clicking, tapping, or hovering.

A [Hyperlink](hyperlink.md) points to a whole document or to a specific element within a document.

[Hypertext](hypertext.md) is text with hyperlinks.

The term was coined by Ted [Nelson](nelson.md) at the start of Project Xanadu.
