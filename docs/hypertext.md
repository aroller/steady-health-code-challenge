[Hypertext](hypertext.md) is text displayed on a computer display or other electronic devices
with references ([Hyperlink](hyperlink.md)) to other text that the reader can immediately access.

[Hypertext](hypertext.md) documents are interconnected by hyperlinks, which are typically activated by a mouse click,
keypress set or by touching the screen.

The term [Hypertext](hypertext.md) was coined by Ted [Nelson](nelson.md) at the start of Project [Xanadu](xanadu.md).

A [Wiki](wiki.md) uses [Hyperlink](hyperlink.md) and [Hypertext](hypertext.md) to connect data.
