A [Wiki](wiki.md) is a website on which users collaboratively modify [Hypertext](hypertext.md)
and structure directly from the web browser.

Ward [Cunningham](cunningham.md), the developer of the first [wiki](wiki.md) software,
originally described it as "the simplest online database that could possibly work".
